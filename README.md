## About

This repo contains most of Varld's static assets for all of our products. The goal is to have one single source of truth for our assets. So when we, for example, change a logo, the change will be reflected on all of Varld's micro-frontends.

To make load-times as fast as possible, the assets are continuously deployed to Vercel's lightning-fast CDN.

## Folders

#### `/logos`

Contains the logos for all of our products. Each product has its own folder. There always is a `logo.svg` and a `logo.png` file.

#### `/launchbase`

This folder contains all assets for launchbases, like illustrations, public scripts and more.

#### `/elements`

This folder contains all assets for launchbases, like illustrations.

## License

Varld's assets are owned by Varld and in some cases our licensors. Please ask us before using any of our assets. 

You can use our logos wherever you want to. You must, however, specify that they are Varld's logos and provide a link to Varld's website.
